image2sgf
=========

Command line script to create an SGF file from an image for Go/Baduk/Weiqi

##### Requirements:
* Python2
* PIL (Python Image Library)

I had images of the Korean Problem Academy tsumego and I used this script to convert them to SGF.

Variables in the script must be tweaked for the images you are trying to convert. They are currently correct for the KPA problems.

To use the script:
`python2 image2sgf.py 'folder/with/images/'`
